# UrlShortener2
A simple URL shortener using ASP.NET MVC and Angular 19.

In this project, the Angular app is embedded in the Razor view using the \<iframe> element, which is definitely not a good practice.  
Unfortunately, my prior experience was limited to building SPAs using Angular 2+ or using Razor Pages with jQuery AJAX methods.  
Only later in the development, when I was doing some additional research, I understood that instead of Angular 19 I should have used AngularJS with Razor Pages similar to how I previously worked with jQuery.
